[Data Cleaning and preparation](#data-cleaning-and-preparation)
The dataset cleaning involves the removal of invalid entries( such as; employees without disclosed gender, null departments and inactive staff without salaries) and analysing the cleaned data to,
---Determine the gender distribution across departments and regions.
---Investigate employees' performance ratings by assigning generic gender status.
---Identify and quantify any gender-based pay gaps, highlighting affected departments and regions.
---Evaluate compliance with the new regulatory salary threshold of $90,000 for manufacturing staff.
--Ensure consistency in data formats; such as name,department,bonus %,and new salary.
--Data Transformation;using Power Query Editor to calculate New fields such as; bonus %,new salary
--Merging of the Palmoria Bonus Rules and Palmoria Group Employee HR Data.

[Exploratory Data Analysis](#exploratory-data-analysi

--- What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and 
departments 
--- Show insights on ratings based on gender 
--- Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If 
there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of 
management 
--- A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay 
employees a minimum of $90,000 
● Does Palmoria meet this requirement? 
● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: 
● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, 
etc.? 
● Also visualize this by regions 
    Case Questions 
--- Mr Gamma thought to himself that since you were already working on the employee 
data, you could help out with allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the 
performance rating. He handed you another data set that contains rules for making bonus 
payments and asked you to: 
●  Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees 
●  Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of 
bonus) 
● Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide
