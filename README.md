The dataset cleaning involves the removal of invalid entries( such as; employees without disclosed gender, null departments and inactive staff without salaries) and analysing the     cleaned data to,
---Determine the gender distribution across departments and regions.

---Evaluate compliance with the new regulatory salary threshold of $90,000 for manufacturing staff.
---Ensure consistency in data formats; such as name,department,bonus %,and new salary.
---Data Transformation;using Power Query Editor to calculate New fields such as; bonus %,new salary

  ## Exploratory Data Analysis:

- What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and 
  departments 
- Show insights on ratings based on gender 
. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If 
  there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of 
  management. 
-  A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay 
employees a minimum of $90,000
* Does Palmoria meet this requirement? 
* Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: 
* How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, 
etc.? 
* Also visualize this by regions  
* Calculation of the the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees 
* Calculating the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of 
  bonus) 
* Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide
