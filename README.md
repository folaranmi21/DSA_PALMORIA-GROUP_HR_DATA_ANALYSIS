  ## Exploratory Data Analysis:

- What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and 
departments 
- Show insights on ratings based on gender 
-  Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If 
there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of 
management 
-  A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay 
employees a minimum of $90,000
* Does Palmoria meet this requirement? 
* Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: 
* How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, 
etc.? 
* Also visualize this by regions  
* Calculation of the the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees 
* Calculating the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of 
bonus) 
* Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide
